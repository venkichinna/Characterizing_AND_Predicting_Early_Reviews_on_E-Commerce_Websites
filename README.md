# CHARACTERIZING AND PREDICTING THE EARLY REVIEWS OFTHE EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS ON E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

## About

When making an informed purchasing decision, users now rely heavily on online reviews. Early product reviews have a significant impact on future product sales. This project investigates the behavioral features of early reviewers using review data from two major e-commerce platforms: Amazon and Yelp.

### Key Objectives:

Analyze the behavior of early reviewers across different product lifecycle stages: early, majority, and laggards.

Study the rating patterns, helpfulness evaluations, and relationship with product popularity.

Develop a margin-based embedding model to predict early reviewers.

## Findings:

- ** Early reviewers tend to provide higher rating scores and publish more helpful reviews.
- ** Their ratings and helpfulness scores significantly influence product popularity.
- ** Our proposed model outperforms competitive baselines in predicting early reviewers.

## Requirements

### User Requirements:

- ** The system must provide an intuitive user interface to access and interact with analysis results.
- ** Interactive visualizations to explore early reviewer characteristics and their impact on sales.
- ** Users should be able to input new reviews and receive predictions on their potential impact.

### System Requirements:

- ** Python 3.7 or later for backend processing.✔ XAMPP as the running platform for required program components.

## Technology Stack

Backend:
Language: Python, SQL
Framework: Django
Frontend Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Purpose: Create an interactive and user-friendly interface for review input, analysis visualization, and recommendation display.
Libraries Used:
- ** Pandas, NumPy – Data processing and analysis✔ TensorFlow – Model training and prediction
Development Platforms:
- ** Python IDE – For backend development✔ VS Code – For frontend and full-stack integration

3rd Party Components:
- ** XAMPP – Provides Apache, MySQL, and PHP support for running the platform API.

## Future Enhancements

- ** Implement Machine Learning models to improve early review predictions.
- ** Expand datasets to cover more e-commerce platforms.
- ** Enhance UI/UX with dynamic dashboards and real-time analysis.
